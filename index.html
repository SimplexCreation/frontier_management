          The central theme in our services is enhancing the Sustainable Economic Development (SED). We help clients analyze and identify fundamental issues and key areas where development projects should be undertaken and advise, formulate, implement, monitor the development projects and also carry out Post-Project reviews and evaluations to measure the impact of such Projects.
        </p>
        <h4>Impact is the Key</h4>
        <p>
          Success of any Development Project will be measured on its Impact with regard to pre-identified objectives. It is a common issue among many Projects where the community is involved, particularly the community development projects that the impact with regard to its specific objectives is hard to achieve. We help in formulating, implementing, development of procedures and systems, monitoring, assessing and auditing etc. so that the objectives of the Project are achieved effectively and efficiently.
        </p>
        <h4>Sustainability through Participation</h4>
        <p>
          In the arena of Development Projects aimed at SED, a unique challenge has been the sustainability. Economic and social sustainability is essential to ensure the long-term impact of Project which could only be possible with effective community participation. Our strategic thinking workshops and brainstorming sessions have enormously helped the clients to discover avenues to ensure community participation and economic and social sustainability. 
       </p>
       <p>
          Project implementing is a challenge. The territory, political, social and economic environment, resource requirements and sources of funding are factors that influence the success of Project implementation. We excel in blending and maneuvering these factors to make the Project a success.

          The Internet and, in particular, the World Wide Web have permeated into every aspect of human activity unlike any other phenomenon in recorded history. Today, over this global medium, people purchase unlimited array of goods and services, perform complex financial transactions, search vast stores of information, enjoy multimedia and also communicate in real time with anybody, anywhere in this world. So it has become a real need rather than a fashion to acquire larger or smaller amount of space in www or in other words World Wide Web for a company forging ahead in business competition. We help our clients to be the best among best of World Wide Web.
      </p>

      <h4>Recognizing the Optimum Solution</h4>
      <p>
        We believe that clients need more than they express. Therefore we use a unique method to recognize the optimum solution by viewing the client’s need in 3 different angles. Client’s point of view, the first approach, basically gives us rough idea and guidelines for recognition of the optimum solution. Secondly we look at the problem in consultant’s point of view, which is very broad and analytical. In this stage skeleton of the optimum solution is defined. Finally, we view the problem in the web master’s point of view. Here we check the technical feasibility of the solution and other practical issues. All three views finally lead us to recognize the optimum solution.
      </p>
      <h4>Maximizing ROI</h4>
        <p>
            Most of the web development companies forget or are ignorant of the term “Maximization of ROI”. We being a client-oriented company do not want our clients to maintain white elephants on the net. Using our expertise we tailor-make our strategies for each and every client to maximize his ROI. Search engine optimization, SEO copywriting, minimizing the download time, identifying and designing exactly for the target audience, creating user-friendly interfaces and enabling e-commerce through sites are some of our techniques which ultimately converts into our strategies on need basis in the process of maximizing the ROI.

      <p>
          MF specialises in impact assessment studies which includes benefit monitoring &amp; performance evaluation and social responsibility audit and systems studies.
      </p>

      <p>
        MF possesses necessary expertise in carrying out impact assessments of any kind of Project, viz Development Projects, Community Based Projects, Social project or Environmental Project etc.
      </p>  

      <p>
        The impact of course the result of Project which could be achieved over a long period of time. Therefore when evaluating the impact of project it is critical to focus on the outcome which are direct or indirect results of the interventions of the particular Project. An efficient and effective data collection, analysis and synthesis process is a key factor that should be planned, institutionalised and implemented by an impact evaluation study. This is an area MF has been excelling in the past few years.

      <h4>What is a Strategy?</h4>
      <p>
          A strategy enables a company or an individual to ensure that day to day decisions fit in with the long-term interest of the organisation or the individual. Strategic decisions have positive impact on future results. Therefore strategic planning is key for the future development and progress and it takes place at the highest management level of the organisation.
      </p>

      <h4>Are you a Strategist?</h4>

          Strategists look at what is happening now in the context of where they want to go. A good Strategist is a team player, skilled communicator, keeps calm when unexpected occurs, balances short and long-term needs and sees problems as opportunities to improve. MF natures and develops business strategists.
